The Fourfold ‘Manam’ Refuge
According to the Drukpa tradition of Drogön Tsangpa Gyare
as recorded by Götsangpa Gönpo Dorje

ma namkha dang nyampé semchen tamché lama sangye chö kyi ku la kyab su chi o
All mother sentient beings as infinite as space take refuge in the guru, the dharmakāya buddha.
ma namkha dang nyampé semchen tamché lama longchö dzokpé ku la kyab su chi o
All mother sentient beings as infinite as space take refuge in the guru, the perfect sambhogakāya.
ma namkha dang nyampé semchen tamché lama tukjé trulpé ku la kyab su chi o
All mother sentient beings as infinite as space take refuge in the guru, the compassionate nirmāṇakāya.
ma namkha dang nyampé semchen tamché lama sangye rinpoche la kyab su chi o
All mother sentient beings as infinite as space take refuge in the guru, the precious buddha.

There are different versions of this practice of the fourfold mother practice within the Kagyü
tradition as a whole but this version accords with the oral tradition of Drogön Tsangpa
Gyare as written down by Götsangpa.
